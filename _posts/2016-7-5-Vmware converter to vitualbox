title: VMware converter to migrate Windows 10 machine to a virtualbox VM (no keyboard)
---

When purchasing a new laptop I like to run the windows install that comes with the laptop as a virtual machine on top of Ubuntu.

In order to do this conversion, the [vmware converter tool](https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/evalcenter?p=converter) works great. Tell it to save your windows install to a virtual disk image (VMDK format). This file can then be opened using virtualbox once you have installed ubuntu.

For virtualbox to run 64bit VMs you may need to change settings in your bios under Security >> Intel Virutalization >> Enable.

Once this is done you can then import the machine image as a Windows 10 64 bit VM. On your first boot of the VM you will find that the screen resolution is reduced and the keyboard may not work. [These instructions](https://blog.destephen.com/wordpress/?p=789) helped me resolve the no keyboard issue. In the meantime I used the on screen keyboard that comes under the ease of access menu either in the startup scrreen or in the control panel.
